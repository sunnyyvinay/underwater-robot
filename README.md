# Underwater Robot

## Description
This robot has 6 motors (2 front, 2 sides, 2 back) and is controlled via joystick. It also has a camera in the front for visibility. The bot should be able to move forward, backward, left, right, up, and down in the water. An Arduino was used to process joystick input and control the motors. The robot structure was 3D printed from a CAD design and the robot was let into the water through a tether connected to the electronic setup.
